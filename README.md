## Description

_A website designed for managing a factory, its machines, and any engineers required for upkeep of the machines. The site allows for navigating listings of machines and engineers, the creation of new machines or engineers, and the ability to edit or delete any specific entry on either listing. Engineers can be assigned to either a single machine, or multiple machines. They can also freely be removed from machines as needed._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You will need [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0), [MySQL](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/get/p/25/file/mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.19.0.msi), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) in order to run the program._

_1: Clone the repository to a folder of choice on your machine (by either using the "Code" button on the GitHub page, or in a terminal application using `git clone https://github.com/igl-myrick/Factory.Solution`)._

_2: Using a terminal application such as Git Bash or Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the top level of the program folder, then into the `Factory` folder._

_3: You will need to create an `appsettings.json` file within the `Factory` folder, including the following code:_

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[YOUR-DB-NAME];uid=[YOUR-USER-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}
```

_Insert your own MySQL username in place of [YOUR-USER-HERE], MySQL password in place of [YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE], and the name of your database in place of [YOUR-DB-NAME]._

_4: Next, run `dotnet build` in the command line to build the program._

_5: Once the program is built, run `dotnet run` to start the program._

_6: When the program is running, navigate to `https://localhost:5001` to view and use the website._

## Known Bugs

* _None at the moment_
